\chapter{Problem Definition}

You are required to implement a tic-tac-toe game using alpha-beta pruning where a user plays against the computer. \\

You are not expected to create a graphical user interface; The game could have a command line interface, but the user must have a way to place an X (or an O) where ever it is possible to do so. But if you think GUI will make it easier for you to test the game, then feel free to use it. \\

Tic-tac-toe is a game with a score of zero, which means that if both players play optimally, no one should win.\\

If you were able to beat the computer (even if it was rare), then this means that your implementation of minimax alpha-beta is incorrect. Every game you play against the computer should end either with a tie or with the computer winning.
